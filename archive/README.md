Action Space for the RL Agent
Your agent will need to make decisions about:
Battery Management: How much to charge or discharge batteries
Grid Interaction: Whether to import from or export to the main grid, and how much
Load Management: Potential load shifting or shedding during peak periods
Generation Control: Adjustments to controllable generation sources if available

Reward Function Design
The reward function is crucial for guiding the agent toward optimal behavior. For microgrid management, consider these components:
Cost Optimization: Minimize electricity costs (negative reward for grid imports at high prices)
Reliability: Ensure consistent power supply (large negative reward for unmet demand)
Battery Health: Maintain battery health (negative reward for extreme charging/discharging)
Renewable Utilization: Maximize use of available renewable energy (positive reward)
Emission Reduction: Reduce reliance on fossil fuels (positive reward for avoiding grid imports from carbon-intensive sources)
